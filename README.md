# Amstrax
Amsterdam Strax

Amstrax is the analysis framework for XAMS, built on top of the generic [strax framework](https://github.com/AxFoundation/strax). 

#Installation
For installing the package do the regular instal-packages-from-github tricks:
```
git clone https://github.com/XAMS-nikhef/amstrax
python ./amstrax/setup.py develop
```
All required dependancies will be installed for you.

#Usage
First you'll need to get some data. For this you'll need to either run somewhere where nikhef's /data/xenon is available or have data downloaded.
Once you have data you can try running the Tutorial notebook (although it's in Dutch), just make sure to change the output_folder to where you have data
